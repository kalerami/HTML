<p>okay, so my goals for learning coding or just career goals in general... again are the following. honey, they can be as outlandish as you want 
    <br> because this is for you 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>increase my structural engineering knowledge a bit
        <ul>
            <li>looking more into resources that interest me</li>
            <li>studying for the PE, just to make sure basic knowledge is good</li>
            <li>learn revit (might take a little longer, but i know i can do it)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>be able to use object-oriented programming for my job (rhino, grasshopper, revit)</li> 
    <li>if transfer job, find something that incorporates programming into daily career or do so at current</li> 
    <li>using this for academia or optimization or for working at McNeel or Autodesk to make resources for engineers</li> 
    <p>if the academia route though,
        <ul>
            <li>find something you are interested in</li>
            <li>where do you think the industry is headed</li>
            <li>where do you think you can make the greatest impact</li>
            <li>do you own research, start your own projects!!</li>
